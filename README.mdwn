# Hackfest in a Box

Hackfest infrastructure as a standalone package you can just run on a
LAN or mesh wireless at your hackfest.

This file is mostly a TODO list for now.

##  Jukebox

 * link to from front page

## Etherpad

Install and run with `make etherpad`, then `cd vendor/etherpad-lite; bin/run.sh`.

TODO: 

 * Need to make a defualt front page by editing etc/etherpad-lite.json
 
 * Lightning Talk signup page

 * Human search engine query signup page

## File dump

 * dir to put files to share

 * dir for presentations that automatically gets sent to the computer attached to the projector

 * dir for photos that get slurped into a hackfest gallery (serve a URL w/ slideshow)
 
 * dir to put music for jukebox?

## Photo Gallery

 * pull photos from file dump (magic dir or just anything that looks like a pic?)
 
 * link to from front page

## IRC channel

 * IRC server
 
 * web-based IRC client
 
 * link to from front page

## Network Gateway

Allows content to be viewed (rw or ro) by people via the internet


If we need logins, we can do something like: Administrator gives a
list of emails to the program.  Or users sign up with their email over
the LAN.  They then get sent a magic url that is their login token.



## Dependencies

 * node.js - Used by etherpad-lite

 * npm - Needed to install node packages for etherpad-lite
 
 * sqlite3 - Back end for etherpad-lite
 
`apt-get install node.js npm sqlite`
